        ## Existing Project Detected
        
        Found existing .opencode system with:
        - **Agents**: {agent_count} ({agent_names})
        - **Subagents**: {subagent_count} ({subagent_names})

        - **Workflows**: {workflow_count}
        
        **How would you like to proceed?**
        
        **Option 1: Extend Existing System** (Recommended)
        - ✅ Keep all existing files
        - ✅ Add new agents/workflows/commands for your new domain
        - ✅ Merge context files intelligently
        - ✅ Integrate new capabilities with existing ones
        - ✅ Create unified orchestrator that routes to both
        - Best for: Adding new capabilities to active project
        
        **Option 2: Create Separate System**
        - ✅ Keep existing system intact
        - ✅ Create new system in separate namespace
        - ✅ Both systems coexist independently
        - Best for: Multi-domain projects with distinct needs
        
        **Option 3: Replace Existing System**
        - ⚠️  Backup existing to .opencode.backup.{timestamp}/
        - ⚠️  Create fresh system (existing work preserved in backup)
        - ⚠️  Use with caution
        - Best for: Complete system redesign
        
        **Option 4: Cancel**
        - Exit without changes

      ```
      
      ### 🚀 Quick Start
      
      **1. Test Your Main Command**:
      ```bash
      /{primary_command} "{example_input}"
      ```
      
      **2. Try a Simple Use Case**:
      ```bash
      /{use_case_command} {example_parameters}
      ```
      
      **3. Review Your Orchestrator**:
      - Open: `.opencode/agent/{domain}-orchestrator.md`
      - Review routing logic and workflows
      - Understand context allocation strategy
      
      ### 📚 Key Components
      
      **Main Orchestrator**: `{domain}-orchestrator`
      - Entry point for all requests
      - Analyzes complexity and routes to specialists
      - Manages 3-level context allocation
      
      **Specialized Agents**:
      {for each subagent:
        - `{subagent.name}`: {subagent.purpose}
      }
      
      **Primary Workflows**:
      {for each workflow:
        - `{workflow.name}`: {workflow.description}
      }
      
      **Custom Commands**:
      {for each command:
        - `/{command.name}`: {command.description}
      }
      
      ### 🧪 Testing Checklist
      
      - [ ] Test main orchestrator with simple request
      - [ ] Test each subagent independently
      - [ ] Verify context files load correctly
      - [ ] Run primary workflow end-to-end
      - [ ] Test custom commands
      - [ ] Validate error handling
      - [ ] Check edge cases
      
      ### 📖 Documentation
      
      - **System Guide**: `.opencode/README.md`
      - **Architecture**: `.opencode/ARCHITECTURE.md`
      - **Context Management**: `.opencode/context/README.md`
      - **Workflow Guide**: `.opencode/workflows/README.md`
      
      ### 🎯 Next Steps
      
      1. **Test the system** with your actual use cases
      2. **Customize context files** with your specific domain knowledge
      3. **Refine workflows** based on real usage
      4. **Add examples** to improve agent performance
      5. **Monitor and optimize** based on results
      
      ### 💡 Tips for Success
      
      - Start with simple use cases and gradually increase complexity
      - Keep context files focused (50-200 lines each)
      - Use Level 1 context (isolation) for 80% of tasks
      - Add validation gates for critical operations
      - Document learnings and patterns as you go
